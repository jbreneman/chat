# simple-node-chat
Simple node chat is an experiment I started to familiarize myself with how sockets work (using socket.io). I kept adding stuff because it was fun!

## Demo
http://projects.jessebreneman.com/chat/

## Usage
Clone the repo to your computer, cd into the directory, then install dependencies using `npm install`. Server can be started with `node server.js`. Load up http://localhost:3000/ and you're in business! The server defaults to port 3000 and root directory, so if you are installing in a subdirectory be sure to change that in the config file.
